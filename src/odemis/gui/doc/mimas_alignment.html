            In this tab, it is possible to align the FIB and Optical lens to a single coincidence point.

            The coincidence plane of the FIB is determined by setting the correct sample stage Z coordinate.
            At the correct sample stage Z, a selected feature will line up vertically (on the same horizontal line) in FIB image.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li>To avoid any drift in Z axis, wait until the temperature of the Cryo sample holder has been stabilized</li>
            <li>Move the stage Z to a fixed position corresponding to a Z that gives a good alignment range for the beam shift</li>
            <li>Move the stage X and Y to a position on a grid which has no features. (it’s possible to move the stage even if the optical image is not playing)</li>
            <li>Play the optical stream using widefield</li>
            <li>Focus optical using right mouse button</li>
            <li>Switch to FIB mode</li>
            <li>Select a FIB imaging preset (ie, 100pA ion-beam current)</li>
            <li>Set FIB horizontal field width to 30µm</li>
            <li>Focus FIB</li>
            <li>Make a hole using milling pattern "align"</li>
            <li>Switch to Optical mode</li>
            <li>Acquire a new optical image, and locate the (new) hole. The hole will be elliptical.</li>
            <li>Move the center of the hole to the center of the image</li>
            <li>Switch to FIB mode</li>
            <li>Activate the FIB imaging</li>
            <li>Adjust the beam shift so that it's at the center of the FoV. (Note: from the stage move, it should be possible to have a very good guess of the beam shift needed)</li>
            <li>Store the beam shift</li>
            <li>Repeat previous step 16 and 17 for every preset (ie, ion-beam current)</li>
